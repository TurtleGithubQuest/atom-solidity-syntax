# atom-solidity-syntax
Solidity syntax support for Atom

Installation:
  1. Copy all files to your atom data folder (default: C:\Users\<user>\.atom)
  2. Restart Atom editor


note:
  Should work with any UI theme (tested: Dark One and Dracula). Hope I did add all new solidity syntax- if so feel free to commit / pm me.
